# zener-pinning-PRISMS-PF
Phase Field Zener Pinning Solidification PRISMS-PF Model

This software is configured for heteregenous nucleation off nanoparticles and mold walls. Nucleation, grain growth, grain coarsening, and grain boundary pinning are all simulated. The code offers the ability to generate distributions of nanoparticles using csv files. The current Initial Conditions are setup for 2D simulations although 3D simulations can be easily accommadated with changing a few lines of code. 

This repositry can be used in conjuction with the open source PRISMS-PF software 
(https://prisms-center.github.io/phaseField/doxygen_files/index.html).

The code housed in this repistory works although there may be a few stray comments in the code. I apologize for any readability issues.
In the future, the code will be cleaned up and annotated for better readability.
This is a temporary location for this code. In the near future, this code is planned to be housed at the Materials Common for a more permanent location.

Code is avaible for use with proper citation. Current preprint link is https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07153.
